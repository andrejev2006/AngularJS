## Intro

My homeworks for the Coursera's Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS class

## Installation

You need to install node, npm first: https://nodejs.org

Then install bower: http://bower.io/

Now open a terminal window and go to the project folder. Then at the prompt type: bower install

Once Bower completes the installation, your project folder is now all set to go forward to work with it.
